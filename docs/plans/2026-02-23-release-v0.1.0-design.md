# Release v0.1.0 Design

Date: 2026-02-23
Repo: DerMaxiAufGit/Game-Site
Branch: master
Target commit: 920b5d4

## Summary
Create the first GitHub release for this repository. The release will be tagged `v0.1.0` and point to the current `master` HEAD. Release notes will be generated automatically by GitHub.

## Goals
- Publish a `v0.1.0` release on GitHub.
- Ensure the release points to the current `master` commit.
- Verify the release exists after creation.

## Non-Goals
- No code changes.
- No branching or history rewriting.
- No additional remotes or tags beyond the release tag.

## Approach
Use the GitHub CLI to create a release from `master` HEAD:
- Create tag `v0.1.0` if it does not already exist.
- Title the release `v0.1.0`.
- Use auto-generated release notes.

## Error Handling
- If `gh` auth or permissions fail, stop and report the error.
- Do not retry with alternate remotes or modify git history.

## Verification
- Confirm the release exists by listing releases and checking for `v0.1.0`.

## Rollback
- If needed, delete the GitHub release `v0.1.0` (and tag) manually with `gh`.
